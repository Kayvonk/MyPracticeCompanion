# How to use My Practice Companion
This isn't rocket science.  We strived to provide a clean interface for navigation and use.  Simply click on what scale you'd like to practice and a music sheet will be generated.  Along with the music sheet a green play button will be generated to play the scale chosen.  Below that a backing track in your chosen scale will be provided as well as a song that is well known to the public in chosen scale.  Information on this video will be provided directly below with Artist Name, Song name, and name of Alblum.  We even include a breif tid bit of information on the band.  Wait it gets even better, we also provide you with a link to access that bands library on LastFM.  

Below your chosen scale we have included a manuel minute counter to track your time.  

Below your counter you will find Additional Resources.  Here we have included the most useful resources for your music educational pursuit.  

Let's say you are interested in learning the blues.  Well you're in luck!  In My Practice Companion you will also have access to "Learn The Blues" found in the Navigation drop bar labeld as Modules.  Here you find a breif description of blues as well as blues in the C scale.  Below this sheet you will find a blue button labled as "C Blues Backing Track" when clicked a random backing track in this scale will be generated.  With each click a new random video will generate. 

If you wish to return to Scales Practice simply move your mouse back over the Module drop down nav and click on "Scale Practice".
